1 Introduction
For instructions on how to complete this homework, see How To Homework. The Twitter website has become a de facto ﬁrst source for many important events in the last decade. Twitter’s hashtag feature lets users tag tweets with single words or phrases (e.g. #superbowl, #algorithms, or #vacaciones). Popular or trending hashtags indicate strong shared interest by many people in a topic, and tracking these trends is of interest to businesses, news outlets, and researchers.

In this homework, you’ll implement an vector-based data structure that tracks information about a collection of hashtags, including which are most popular, i.e. are trending.1
2 Instructions
The following ﬁles have been given to you: 1. A C++ header ﬁle (trendtracker.h) declaring the Trendtracker class. 2. A C++ source ﬁle (main.cpp) containing a main function with tests. 3. A text ﬁle (common.txt) containing 3612 common English words.2 Download the ﬁles at https://andrewwinslow.com/3333/hwTT1/ Create a new C++ source ﬁle named trendtracker.cppthatimplementstheTrendtrackerclass, sothattrendtracker.cppandtheprovidedﬁlescompileintoaprogramthatrunswithnofailedtests. Submitthesourceﬁletrendtracker.cpp.
3 Submission and Grading
Submit the aforementioned source ﬁle(s) via Blackboard as attached ﬁle(s). In the case of multiple submissions, the last submission before the deadline is graded. For grading, each submission is compiled with the provided ﬁles and run. Submissions that do not run to completion (i.e. fail to print “Assignment complete.”) receive no credit. Submissions that take an unreasonable amount of time (e.g. more than a minute or so) to run and do not meet the asymptotic eﬃciency requirements receive no credit. All other submissions receive full credit. See the course late work policy for information about receiving partial credit for late submissions.
